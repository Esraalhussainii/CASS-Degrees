## Introduction
The CASS Degrees Program Planner is a tool which aims to facilitate students enrolled in CASS degrees to easily manage and personalise their degree program.

#### Need for Project
The process of planning for a degree plan can be extremely confusing, especially for students who are new to university. The College of Arts and Social Sciences (CASS) has recognised this issue and is taking steps to make this process easier for their students. By creating this product, they are primarily hoping the following benefits will be achieved:
* Help students avoid issues with possible future legislation that will prevent them from completing more than the number of courses required by their degree
* Provide a tool that will make it easier and less stressful to plan their degree
* Simplify the manual processes used by CASS staff to help students plan their degree

A more detailed list of project benefits can be found in the [MVP Problem and Benefits Statement](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IJ_FJ4hzZf6kgmfbK3YP0H3ODYEdl_0jCjqyXc3aGG8) and in the  [Statement of Work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--KoS8IbUjbAqelNh_rJYU_NUcWlk00LU79EfL2-Iy4).


#### Client Vision
The tool should expand on existing paper-based templates to assist students in selecting courses that will help them graduate on time according to the rules of their degree. It should draw on data from Programs and Courses and the expertise of course advisors to account for legal program variations and accommodate a wide berth of unique degree permutations. The client has requested an open source system, but is open to how the final product will be implemented.

#### Semester One Goals
In Semester One, the team delivered a program authoring tool. This tool aimed to streamline the process for template creation, allowing CASS staff to generate program models with the necessary data to populate an interim paper template generated by the tool.

#### Semester Two Goals
The project will continue from the 22nd July - 25th October, refining the template authoring tool according to UAT feedback, and developing the planner proof of concept.

The program planner tool will be completed as per the specifications, and will be accessible to CASS only as a prototype upon conclusion of the project. A public portal must be accessible for students to download completed plans. The template authoring tool will continue to be developed with weekly user acceptance testing to determine requirements.

## Stakeholders

#### Client

Deborah Veness and Frederick Chew of the College of Art and Social Sciences expect a working program that will allow students of the Australian National University to manage their degrees. They have a large Wishlist of requirements but accept that only an essential fraction of those may be completed given time constraints.

#### Developers

The development team of the CASS Degrees project expect to produce at least a minimum viable product for the clients by the end of the program, and endeavour to leave the repository in a clean state for handover to any further teams that follow.

#### Programs and Courses/ISIS Administrators

Administrators of Programs and Courses and ISIS are responsible for the security of student and course information. As our project hopes to use this data, it is imperative that we come to an agreement with administrators on what we can and cannot gain access to.

#### Users
Users of the CASS Degree Planner expect a functional program that is intuitive to use, efficient, and accurate. They expect to be able to evaluate the validity of their degree plan and to be presented with options that enable them to complete their degree on time.

#### Stakeholder Engagement
We will be engaging our stakeholders regularly to collect feedback and keep them up to date with our progress. Accounting for the varying stakes each party holds in our project, we will be engaging them differently. More detailed information regarding this can be found in our [Communications Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14_TTOyZzZROlgy_2PFObUQcVHOLv-XMpO1PerCBhcNE?usp=sharing).

## Project Approach
#### Progress Tracking
Every week, or at appropriate intervals, our team will complete a status report detailing a summary of recent actions, feedback, and decisions, a forecast of the coming interval, and an analysis of potential risks and mitigations. Taken in sequence, these reports will describe the progress of our project from start to finish.

Additionally, we will be using Git Issues to manage planned actions and milestones. This will allow us to track our velocity over time.

#### Decision Making
As a team we make decisions during the various meetings we have each week. Decisions are made democratically, with a consensus being found among all members before it is settled and recorded. Split matters are settled by vote.

#### Meeting Schedule
Tutorial meetings are held every Thursday from 5pm to 7pm and are facilitated by our tutors Anthony and David, with our shadow team, Public Health 2. This time is used to receive outside insight into the state of our project and to give feedback on our shadow team's project.

We intend to schedule a fortnightly meeting with our clients for feedback and requirement gathering.

Team meetings infrequently occur on Wednesday from 5:00pm to 6:00pm. Team meetings are a chance for the development team to organise ourselves around the feedback we've received and to determine how we should move forwards given the tasks we have.

More detailed information regarding this can be found in our [Communications Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14_TTOyZzZROlgy_2PFObUQcVHOLv-XMpO1PerCBhcNE?usp=sharing).

#### Communication
Our team has decided to use Slack for its official communication channel. This will allow us to easily hand over the project and its documentation to any team which may take over after us. This will also allow us to include our clients and get more rapid responses.

Additionally, we will continue to use Facebook Messenger as an informal channel for keeping our team up to date and managing non-project matters.

More detailed information regarding this can be found in our [Communications Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14_TTOyZzZROlgy_2PFObUQcVHOLv-XMpO1PerCBhcNE?usp=sharing).

#### Risk Management
Potential Risks of the project have been outlined and managed in our Risk Register. The register lists potential risks which may happen and provides strategies to avoid or solve them. See [Risk Register](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16VNgkBs3rKWezIkiO1ovMCDx6blobRHIYs8ZbZOl3K0)

These risks will be outlined by the Risk Identification committee and regularly updated as the project continues.

The Risk Management Plan describes the formal process of how we manage and discover risks and can be found here: [Risk Management Plan](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iUkYaQKMDL7mGSwdNpoIu-KCUZ1_6Yhwv1flvfUmHpU).

#### Reflection
The team receives feedback both from tutors and the shadow team every audit week, after which the team will determine the feasibility of each feedback item and implement the suggestions where possible.

As previously mentioned, client meetings are also scheduled every fortnight to gain actionable feedback directly from the client and to ensure the product is being developed correctly.

Furthermore, all changes to the product are freely accessible on GitHub, and members are encouraged to review the changes made by other team members in order to ensure the best approach was used.

We also track the feedback given during Audits and then as a team review them and action accordingly.
